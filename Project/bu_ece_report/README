This is a BU ECE Technical report preparation package for LaTeX/BiBTeX
typsetting environment. It has been tested under Linux, but should work under
MikTeX on Windows.

The package specifies report style (either generic report style with chapters
or article style with sections) to assure uniformity among reports from
different authors. It also defines cover page formatted to fit the cutout in BU
report cardboard covers. This makes for a nice bound copy of a report.

In order to get your technical report number, contact the administrative
secretary of the Department Chair (PHO324), and provide him/her with report
title and authors. The department does not have a repository of past technical
reports but records report titles, author names and report numbers.

The following files are included in the package:

  bu_ece_report.sty	 - BU ECE technical report LaTeX style file,
  fancybox.sty           - fancy box style file for the title-box page,
  fancyheadings.sty      - fancy headings style file for advanced headings,
  BUseal_color.eps	 - BU seal EPS file,
  BUlogo_pantone.eps 	 - BU logo EPS file (pantone 186 red),
  BUlogo_cmyk.eps 	 - BU logo EPS file (cmyk red),
  BUlogo_black.eps 	 - BU logo EPS file (black),
  ieeetr.bst       	 - unsorted IEEE BiBTeX style file,
  ieeetrsrt.bst   	 - sorted IEEE BiBTeX style file,
  report.tex     	 - LaTeX template for a report,

The first five files (bu_ece_report.sty, fancybox.sty, fancyheadings.sty)
specify the BU ECE report style.

The next two files (ieeetr.bst, ieeetrsrt.bst) are recommended as the
bibliography style (unsorted and sorted, respectively) for the BU ECE technical
reports.

Finally, report.tex is a template LaTeX file that is suggested as a starting
point for the preparation of a BU ECE technical report (report.bbl is needed
for the compilation of report.tex).
